Volume 1: The Curious Case of the Biased Bots

🗂️ Case #1: The Hiring Bot
👀 What the AI is doing:
An AI-powered hiring assistant has been developed by a company with the objective of going through all submitted resumes and determine which ones merit an interview. The AI examines prior training, education, work history, and trends from productive workers. Reducing the amount of time spent reviewing applications seems like a recruiter's dream.
🚨 Suspicious activity spotted:
But dig deeper and the cracks appear:
•	Gender bias: The bot starts rejecting more female applicants who have career gaps as result of model training data. Model was trained using the data of the company’s previous employees. If the historical data favored men with uninterrupted work histories, the AI just repeats that discrimination.
•	Fairness failure: Career gaps don’t always mean poor skills. They could mean maternity leave, caregiving, or even retraining. Punishing this unfairly shuts out talented candidates and cause gender inequality in core sectors.
•	Lack of transparent feedback : Most applicant do not receive clarity on the reasons for rejection.
      🛠️ How to fix responsibly:
•	Retrain with bias checks: Remove harmful patterns (like penalizing gaps) from the data and test results across gender, race, and age groups.
•	Add explainability: Applicants deserve to know why they weren’t selected. 
•	Value caregiving experience: Life skills—like problem-solving, multitasking, leadership—should be recognized, not erased, model should be adjusted to consider gender during selection.
Mr Bot, you better don’t like a lazy detective.

🗂️ Case #2: The School Proctoring AI
👀 What the AI is doing:
Schools under exam pressure roll out an AI proctor. Students sit at home with webcams while the AI watches for “suspicious behavior.” Eye movements, head turns, or leaving the screen can trigger red flags. On paper, this promises integrity and fairness—everyone’s being “watched equally.”
🚨 Suspicious activity spotted:
•	Disability discrimination: Students who are neurodivergent (e.g., ADHD, autism, Tourette’s) or have anxiety may move differently. Their natural behaviors get flagged as “cheating.”
•	Privacy overreach: Students’ homes become surveillance zones, with cameras peering into bedrooms and personal spaces. That’s an intrusion.
•	Accountability gap: Once flagged, students may not have a way to appeal. An algorithm’s “judgment” becomes a final verdict, even if unfair.
🛠️ How to fix responsibly:
•	Human in the loop: The AI should only raise alerts, never convict. A teacher or proctor should review the footage to confirm.
•	Accessibility options: Provide alternatives (in-person exams, extended time, or less intrusive proctoring tools) for students with special needs.
•	Transparency: Schools must tell students exactly what behaviors are being monitored and how the system makes decisions.
This AI is like a paranoid security guard who thinks “anyone looking around must be hiding something.” The fix? Pair it with a wise teacher who can interpret context.
